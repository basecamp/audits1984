# Audits1984

A simple auditing tool for [`console1984`](https://github.com/basecamp/console1984).

## Installation

Add it to your `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem 'audits1984'
```

Create tables to store audits in the database:

```sh
rails audits1984:install:migrations
rails db:migrate
```

Mount the engine in your `routes.rb`:

```ruby
mount Audits1984::Engine => "/console"
```

### API-only apps or apps using `vite_rails` and other asset pipelines outside Rails

If you want to use this gem with an [API-only Rails app](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/api_app.html) or an app that's using `vite_ruby`/`vite_rails`, or some other custom asset pipeline different from Sprockets and Propshaft, you need just one more thing: configure an asset pipeline so you can serve the JavaScript and CSS included in this gem. We recommend to use [`Propshaft`](https://github.com/rails/propshaft). You simply need to add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "propshaft"
```

Then execute
```bash
$ bundle install
```

And you should be ready to go.

### Authenticate auditors

By default, the library controllers will inherit from the host application's `ApplicationController`. To authenticate auditors, you need to implement a method `#find_current_auditor` in your `ApplicationController`. This method must return a record representing the auditing user. It can be any model but it has to respond to `#name`.

For example, Imagine all the staff in your company can audit console sessions:

```ruby
def find_current_auditor
  Current.user if Current.user&.staff?
end
```

## Usage

The main screen lists the registered console sessions. It includes a form to filter sessions by date, and also to only show that contains sensitive accesses.

![Main screen listing the registered console sessions with a filter form](docs/images/main-screen.png)

You can click on a session to see its commands and choose whether it was an appropiate console usage or not.

After making a decision on the session, you will be redirected to the next pending session, based on the filter configured in the main screen.

That's it. I said it was simple.

## Configuration

These config options are namespaced in `config.audits1984`:

| Name                  | Description                                                  |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| auditor_class         | The name of the auditor class. By default it's `::User.`     |
| auditor_name_attribute | The attribute on the auditor class that returns the auditor's name. By default it's `:name`. |
| base_controller_class | The host application base class that will be the parent of `audit1984` controllers. By default it's `::ApplicationController`. |
